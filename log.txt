- Created classes: Deck, Cards, Player, Human, Computer, Game, Round, FiveCrowns
- Constructors for Cards. Added toString() function that returns string representation of the card object.
- Constructors for Deck. Deck has private member variables: deck, discard pile, and draw pile.
- all of these are deque.
- createDeck() function and createJoker function added.
- worked on client side code. Initialized players here. But need to move this to game class.
- the toss function also needs to be in game class.

- created shuffleDeck() function using shuffle function from <bits/stdc++.h> library.
- added Hand to player member vars. It is a vector of Cards since it keeps increasing. Also, updating is much easier in vectors.
- constructed round class, it assigns round number and players.
- added start, load, and play function in round class.
- added getCards(int num) in Deck class to distribute cards for player hands.
- added printRoundStatus() prints the status of the round.

- in load() of game string comparision for next player not working. TODO
- made deck a singleton class so that it can be accessed from any other class with no copy issues.
- added play() function to the player class. coded for human. Displays menu and calls necessary functions.
- added goOut() and pickCard() functions to the player class.
- found out the reason for not loading the game. The values have a space in the beginning. so used str.erase() for that.
