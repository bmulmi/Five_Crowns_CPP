- Created classes: Deck, Cards, Player, Human, Computer, Game, Round, FiveCrowns
- Constructors for Cards. Added toString() function that returns string representation of the card object.
- Constructors for Deck. Deck has private member variables: deck, discard pile, and draw pile.
- all of these are deque.
- createDeck() function and createJoker function added.
- worked on client side code. Initialized players here. But need to move this to game class.
- the toss function also needs to be in game class.

9/12/2019
- created shuffleDeck() function using shuffle function from <bits/stdc++.h> library.
- added Hand to player member vars. It is a vector of Cards since it keeps increasing. Also, updating is much easier in vectors.
- constructed round class, it assigns round number and players.
- added start, load, and play function in round class.
- added getCards(int num) in Deck class to distribute cards for player hands.
- added printRoundStatus() prints the status of the round.

9/14/2019
- in load() of game string comparision for next player not working. TODO
- made deck a singleton class so that it can be accessed from any other class with no copy issues.
- added play() function to the player class. coded for human. Displays menu and calls necessary functions.
- added goOut() and pickCard() functions to the player class.
- found out the reason for not loading the game. The values have a space in the beginning. so used str.erase() for that.

9/18/2019
- found a bug in load() function. the hands and deck were not loading correctly.
- added setWildCard() function that sets the wild card's face in the deck class.
- TODO: Round changing. needs restructuring
- added isRun() and isBook() functions to the Player class
- added canGoOut() function that checks if the player can go out or not.
- added extractJokerCards() function that takes the vector as reference, removes the wild cards and jokers from the vector and
returns them.
- added hasSameSuite() that checks if the hand cards are of the same suite.
- added sortCards() function that sorts the Cards in ascending order
- added swapCards() function that swaps two cards.
- refactored previousPlayer to currPlayer to keep track of current player. MUST CHECK THIS!

9/19/2019
- put the currPlayer assignment within the else statement right before nextPlayer is changed.
- TODO: check if a wild card is a part of a run or a book.
        This makes a difference while counting the cards.

9/21/2019
- added save game function in round and game
- saveGame does not show score. TODO

9/22/2019
- save game works correctly now.

9/26/2019
- added extractWildCardsSameSuite and extractWildCardsDiffSuite functions
- re added the extractWildCards function so that isRun and isBook can work in such a way that
    it checks any vector of cards regardless of wild card inclusion
- permutations of the card added
- added a function that returns combination indices of the vector of cards for checking
- ERROR: cannot access memory at location! discard pile first card's face

9/29/2019
- made deck a protected member of the player class to solve the copy issue of deck instance
- found out that shuffle deck function did not collect hand cards and was just joining discard and draw pile!!
- thats why the code was breaking down on the 9th round because there was not enough card to distribute!!!
- created new function called arrangeDeck(numDecks) that combines the number of decks into one pile.
- shuffle card now uses the arrangeDeck function to combine the two decks into a discard pile and shuffles them.
- added bool isMissingCards in canBeRun function so that all the missingCards are counted and then returned.
- isBook() now does not extract wild cards, instead it skips them in the loop.
- added enum TYPE in Validate to make the isRun and isBook more precise.
- changed the return types wherever isRun or isBook is used.
